This repository contains some work that I produced while working at Provape.  There are 2 folders, the NG_Code and Tester.

NG_Code was experimental code I wrote that would have been used on a new device, rewriting the entire codebase to include FreeRTOS kernal.  Most of the BSP was finished, but code testing was still ongoing.  The code was written for the EFM32LG330F128, a Freescale (now NXP) Kinetis ARM Cortex-M3 chip.

The Tester folder is a library I wrote to control various Weeder test boards produced by Weeder Technologies.  The code was written for use in the Linux environment.
